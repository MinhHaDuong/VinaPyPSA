Open Vietnam power system analysis from an electrical engineering point of view

2019-08-08

## Aims and scope
The long term goals of this project are to study the impact of climate change on the electricity supply in Vietnam, and to study the integration of offshore wind power in the system.

For a start we aim to reproduce Kies et al. (2018) Integration of Renewable Power Sources into the Vietnamese Power System
